# Augmenta-Max4L-spatializer-plugin

Augmenta OSC spatializer is a tool to produce music from movement of objects in space.
It can receive persons or objects position in space from different sources : [Augmenta tracking system](www.augmenta-tech.com) (persons and objects), [touchOSC](https://hexler.net/products/touchosc) (phone), or any XY coordinates through osc.
Then it can be used for triggering or mapping any music effect in Ableton Live or MAX Msp.
